# D-Dadventure.py
A Simple Python game.

Finished!It is very basic, so add as you wish.


This is quite different to the original idea, which was a interactable game using Pygame zero, but it took too much of my time. So I will _try_ to do it during the holidays but I can't guarantee it.

# Functions
In this text-based game, we use the command:

`Import colorama`

Then:

`from colorama import Fore`

To print Colour text.
